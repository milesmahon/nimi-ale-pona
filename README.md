# Searchable English-Toki Pona dictionary
https://milesmahon.github.io/nimi-ale-pona/

toki pona is a philosophical artistic constructed language created by linguist and translator Sonja Lang. It's original vocabulary is minimal (officially around 120 words), but new words have been been adopted by speakers of the language. These new words are called "non-pu" or "post-pu" words ("pu" meaning approximately: "of or relating to the official toki pona book").

## "Philosophical Language"
Languages shape how we express ourselves and, in some ways, how we think. Minimalist languages with small vocabularies, like toki pona, force us to break down complex ideas into the basic parts from which they're constructed.

`jan pona (lit. "person good") ->  friend`

`jan meli lawa (lit. "person woman control/rule/guide") -> queen`

This is one of many "restrictions" of the language. Another is that there are very few cardinal numbers:

`wan -> one`

`tu -> two`

`mute -> many, several`

This makes toki pona not well suited for business, which is probably a good thing.

## "Non-pu" words
Some words were not originally explicitly defined but now are,

`tonsi -> non-binary, gender-nonconforming (from Mandarin 同志)`

some are shorter versions of toki pona phrases,

`kamalawala -> anarchy, uprising (from "kama pi lawa ala", lit. "arrival of no control/rule/guide")`

some are jokes, and some arose out of necessity.
